  - >
    Maintained Douyin nearline data streams for video index
    and candidate databases.
    Enabled RocksDB based KV store to do column based updates
    and row based reads.
    Improved telemetry under multi-tenancy scenarios on the pipeline,
    avoiding particular user to overwhelm shared data buses.
  - >
    Optimized Douyin and TikTok video database storage by
    normalizing one monolithic table into video index and user index,
    improving user info consistency and cache efficacy,
    and simplifying user info lookup.
  - >
    Independently proposed, designed and implemented a Python
    light-weight streaming processing engine,
    and successfully deployed for vertical channels in Douyin
    such as local retail.
    Main features includes an epoll based event-driven loop
    for high throughput data transfer between Python processes,
    a multi-tier health monitoring and failure recovery mechanism
    on top of Kubernetes,
    seamless backward compatibility to minimize migration costs.
    By decoupling between vertical channels and Douyin main feed,
    they enjoy fast iteration and high reliability at the same time.
