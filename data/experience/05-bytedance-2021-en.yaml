  - >
    Developed and maintained Douyin's nearline data streams, video indices,
    and candidate databases. Developed RocksDB-based KV storage indexing
    module supporting column-based updates and row-based reads.
  - >
    Implemented comprehensive resource monitoring and governance mechanisms
    for multi-tenant scenarios, preventing individual services from
    overloading the main recommendation data pipeline and avoiding excessive
    index storage consumption.
  - >
    Improved Douyin and TikTok video database architecture by splitting
    monolithic index into separate video and user indices. Improved online
    cache hit rates and enhanced user information consistency while
    simplifying social feature data access.
  - >
    Independently designed and implemented a lightweight Python-based stream
    processing engine, successfully deployed for Douyin vertical channels
    including group buying. Core capabilities: epoll-based event-driven
    architecture for high-throughput IPC; Kubernetes-native health
    monitoring and automated failure recovery; full backward compatibility
    while facilitating business development iteration. Achieved faster
    feature iteration and reliability by completely decoupling vertical
    businesses from the main recommendation feed.
